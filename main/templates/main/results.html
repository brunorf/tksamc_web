                        The TKSA-MC method indicates the residues which contribute
                        to destabilizing the protein native state. The algorithm
                        calculates the protein electrostatic energy taking into
                        account the contribution of each residue with polar charged
                        side chain. Figure 1 presents an example of
                        &Delta;G<sub>qq</sub> bar graph for ubiquitin protein <sup>1</sup>.

                            PDB ID: 1UBQ. There was taken into account a total of 25
                            ionizable groups been NTR and CTR the N and C terminal, respectively.

                        The bars indicate the charge-charge energy contribution

                        stability. The red bars indicate the candidate residues
                        to be mutated to increase the protein thermostability and
                        the selection criteria follows the methodology introduce

                        It was indicated the residue which present unfavorable
                        energy values &Delta;G<sub>qq</sub> &ge; 0 and are exposed to
                        solvent with SASA &ge; 50%. In ubiquitin example the
                        highlighted residues are K06, E24 and K48 and this

                        its respective &Delta;G<sub>qq</sub> and SASA values. All the

                        given as a sum of the &Delta;G<sub>qq</sub> for each ionizable

                        The &Delta;G<sub>elec</sub> for the ubiquitin protein in pH 5.5

                        The total energy contribution &Delta;G<sub>elec</sub> is a pH
                        dependent measure. The ionization degree of each polar
                        residue side chain and its &Delta;G<sub>qq</sub> vary with the
                        pH input value. Figure 2 presents an example
                        of &Delta;G<sub>elec</sub> as a function of pH for ubiquitin protein.
